SOLITARE GAME
-------------

This example tries to calculate the reachable state space of the
Solitare game. The board is sketched below. At the beginning all
places except number 17 has a pin in them. A pin may be moved by
jumping over another pin into an empty place. The pin in between is
then removed. The goal is to remove all pins execept one - which
should be left in the center.

It took a few hours to run this example on a Alpha machine and it
required some 8000000 BDD nodes.
