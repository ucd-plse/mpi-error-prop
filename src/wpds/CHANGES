WALi/OpenNWA 4.0:
  General features
  - Added 'scons CXX=...' to choose compiler and strong_warnings=0 to disable
    extra warning flags

  General bug fixes
  - Fixed building with broader range of compilers

  WALi features:
  - Added postorder visit functions to the witness visitor
  - Significant API changes to the BinRel domain, and addition of a feature
    to output diagrams
  - Added a new callback class, DotAttributePrinter, which allows someone
    calling WFA::print_dot to output extra attributes for either nodes
    or edges.
  - Added printStatistics() functions to WFA and WPDS

  OpenNWA features:
  - Added NWA statistics functions num{Call,Entry,Exit,Return}Sites in
    opennwa::query (opennwa/query/automaton.hpp)

  WALi bug fixes:
  - Fixed a rather bad efficiency problem with path_summary; on large examples
    this can run almost an order of magnitude faster.
  - Use the cached theZero object in WPDS::post instead of creating a new
    zero; this is important if you have a class (like Witness) that doesn't
    cache its own zeroes.
  - There is an optional setting to make Witness cache its zeros and ones.

  OpenNWA bug fixes:
  - Updated license and author information
  - Fixed a bad performance problem with the NWA to WPDS conversion. Our code
    didn't match our tech report. Our tech report created a number of PDS
    states that was linear in the number of return points. Our code created a
    number that was cubic. Oops.


WALi/OpenNWA 4.0 RC1:

 - This is where records basically peter out without looking into the
   Subversion logs.
